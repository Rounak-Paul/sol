Write clean and production ready code. Performance and Stability must be first priority. Write maintainable code. Dont have duplicate logics and hacky implementation. Follow good practices. Any refactor should be clean and no backward compatible deadcode should be left behind. Must be memory safe. No need excessive comments in code, only have important comments. We are also working on tinyvk, this is my own GUI library, so upgrading tinyvk is also allowed as required.
