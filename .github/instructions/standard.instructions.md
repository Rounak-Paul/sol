Write clean and production ready code. Performance and Stability must be first priority. Write maintainable code. Dont have duplicate logics and hacky implementation. Follow good practices. Any refactor should be clean and no backward compatible deadcode should be left behind. Must be memory safe. No need excessive comments in code, only have important comments. We are also working on tinyvk, this is my own GUI library, so upgrading tinyvk is also allowed as required. Write modular and reusable code. Handle edge cases and errors properly. Follow best practices, unless it will hamper performance or stability. Review your own code. Avoid too many unnecessery specilized function and classes, but also avoid too much generalization. Avoid over engineering. No documentation is needed.
